# Logistic Regression on the Titanic dataset

Kaggle's intro to machine learning dataset.

Uses logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survives or dies.

The dataset is imbalanced, so we are using a confusion matrix to most precisely identify True Positives. We're using cross validation to protect against overfitting.
